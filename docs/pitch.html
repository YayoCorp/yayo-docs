  <p>Esoteric Pitch:</p>
  <p>The World Trade Centre is goneâ€” YAYO takes its place as the most triumphant monument to the capitalist ideal ever erected. Our friends at the visionary genius underground avant garde art collective hivemind have conceived of The New Way to Make Tomorrow's Money, Today. The World is truly is ours. And it can be yours, too.
  </p>
  
  <p>Basic Pitch:</p>
<p>YAYO is the first memecoin on the MATIC network, well positioned to take the hype that&#39;s come to it as a gasless ETH alternative. It&#39;s well managed, with strong marketing production and a very novel aesthetic making for a highly strategic launch targeting untapped crypto niches.</p>

<p>Long Pitch:</p>
<p>$YAYO takes $RFI&#39;s standard burn &amp; redistribute tokenomics, which recent successes like $KISHU have copied, but with rates adjusted for higher aggression (2.5/2.5% burn/redistribute), lower total supply (69MM, with 50% sent on deploy to a burn wallet).</p>
<p>Most importantly its ported to the near-zero gas fee Polygon/Matic sidechain, which pumped during the market crash as the most viable solution for DeFi on Ethereum -- the low gas fees also means lower barrier of entry for small budget buyers which make up the majority of a memecoin market. $YAYO is the first memecoin on Polygon/Matic so it&#39;s well positioned to take all the hype coming to it.</p>
<p>$YAYO&#39;s contract follows all standard transparency/security protocols: verifiable burn address, launched through UniCrypt Launchpad for fairly managed presale with a buy limit per wallet to minimize whales, delivered directly into a one year smart contract liquidity lock. Founder wallets are locked and released slowly over time on a public vesting schedule also throught UniCrypt. The coin is a simple smart contract which runs itself post-launch, with a third-party security audit in the process. </p>
<p>$YAYO&#39;s launch is highly strategic, leveraging a series of semi-exclusive airdrops in key influencer, college &amp; financebro networks to seed the $YAYO community with untapped high-value niches. </p>
<p>Collective community emphasis is centered on high-power memetics to maintain consistent and robust upwards push targeting The One Billion Dollar Market Cap - we can do it better than anyone else. Not a memecoin, not a shitcoin, but a POWERcoin. </p>
