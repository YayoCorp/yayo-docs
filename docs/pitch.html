<p>Basic Pitch:</p>
<p>YAYO is the first memecoin on the MATIC network, well positioned to take the hype that&#39;s come to it as a gasless ETH alternative. It&#39;s well managed, with strong marketing production value and a very novel aesthetic making for a highly strategic launch.</p>

<p>Long Pitch:</p>
<p>$YAYO takes $RFI&#39;s standard burn &amp; redistribute tokenomics, which recent successes like $KISHU have copied, but with rates adjusted for higher aggression (2.5/2.5% burn/redistribute), lower total supply (69MM, with 50% locked to a burn wallet).</p>
<p>Most importantly its ported to the near-zero gas fee Polygon/Matic sidechain, which pumped during the market crash as the most viable solution for DeFi on Ethereum -- the low gas fees also means lower barrier of entry for small budget buyers which make up the majority of a memecoin market. $YAYO is the first memecoin on Polygon/Matic so it&#39;s well positioned to take all the hype coming to it.</p>
<p>$YAYO&#39;s contract is follows all standard transparency/security protocols: verifiable burn address, launched through UniCrypt Launchpad for fairly managed presale with a buy limit per wallet to minimize whales, delivered directly into a one year smart contract liquidity lock. Founder wallets are locked and released slowly over time on a public vesting schedule also throught UniCrypt. The coin is a simple smart contract which runs itself post-launch, with a third-party security audit in the process. </p>
<p>$YAYO&#39;s launch is highly strategic, leveraging a series of semi-exclusive airdrops in key influencer, college &amp; financebro networks to seed the $YAYO community with untapped high-value niches. </p>
<p>Collective community emphasis is centered on high-power memetics to maintain consistent and robust upwards push targeting The One Billion Dollar Market Cap - we can do it better than anyone else. Not a memecoin, not a shitcoin, but a POWERcoin. </p>
